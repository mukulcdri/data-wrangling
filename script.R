## Exercise 2
# Create a new variable called `math_achievement` with a value of:
#     * `"High"` if a district's Math proficiency is 75% or higher;
#     * `"Medium"` if a district's Math proficiency is between 50% and 75%;

## Exercise 4
# Do the following in one sequence of function calls, piped together:
# 1. Read in the `data/tvaas.csv` file.
# 2. Rename variables as follows:
#     * `District Name` to `system`.
#     * `District-Wide: Composite` to `TVAAS Composite`.
#     * `District-Wide: Literacy` to `TVAAS Literacy`.
#     * `District-Wide: Numeracy` to `TVAAS Numeracy`.
# 3. Drop the `District Name` variable.

# * A district's average proficiency in math subjects (Math, Algebra I-II)
# * A district's average proficiency in English subjects (ELA, English I-III)
# * A district's average proficiency in science subjects (Science, Biology I, Chemistry)
# Then, reorder variables such that:
# * The math average is next to the individual math variables.
